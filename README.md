]This Swift project is a console-based application that combines four mini-games and utilities into a single program, navigable via a main menu. It offers an interactive experience with the following components:

To-Do List: Manage tasks by adding, viewing, marking as completed, or deleting them. Each task has a title and a status (completed/pending).

Guessing Game: Guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed.

Quiz Game: Answer multiple-choice questions, with the game tracking your score. The program provides feedback on whether your answer is correct and displays the final score at the end.

Tic-Tac-Toe: A two-player game where players alternate placing marks ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for a win or draw after each move and displays the final result.
